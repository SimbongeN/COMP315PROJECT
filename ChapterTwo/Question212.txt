The braking force in a bicycle primarily depends on which type of friction?|a) Static friction;b) Rolling friction;c) Kinetic friction;d) Fluid friction|c|Consider the type of friction involved when the bicycle's wheels are in motion while braking.
If the coefficient of friction between the bicycle tires and the road is 0.6, and the normal force exerted by the bicycle is 500 N, what is the frictional force?|a) 100 N;b) 300 N;c) 600 N;d) 800 N|b|Use the formula for frictional force: F=μ×N, where μ is the coefficient of friction and N is the normal force.
Which of the following can increase the frictional force between the bicycle’s brakes and the wheel?|a) Reducing the surface area of brake pads;b) Using smoother brake pads;c) Increasing the pressure applied to the brakes;d) Applying lubricants to the brake pads|c|Think about what directly increases the contact between the brake pads and the wheel, or makes the interaction more forceful.
What happens to the braking force if the road is wet?|a) It increases;b) It remains unchanged;c) It decreases;d) It depends on the weight of the bicycle|c|Wet surfaces tend to reduce the effectiveness of friction. Think about how water affects the contact between surfaces.
A cyclist applies brakes, but the wheels lock, causing the bicycle to skid. What type of friction is now acting between the tires and the road?|a) Static friction;b) Rolling friction;c) Kinetic friction;d) Fluid friction|c|Skidding occurs when the wheels stop rolling but continue sliding, which involves friction between moving surfaces.
If the coefficient of friction between the road and the bicycle tires increases, what happens to the stopping distance?|a) It increases;b) It decreases;c) It remains unchanged;d) It depends on the rider's weight|b|More friction means the brakes can stop the bike more effectively.
A cyclist moving at 8 m/s comes to a stop in 16 meters. If the speed was instead 16 m/s, what would the stopping distance be (assuming the same braking force)|a) 32 meters;b) 48 meters;c) 64 meters;d) 16 meters|c|Compare the squared values of the speeds, since stopping distance is proportional to speed².
A cyclist applies the brakes but notices the bicycle skidding instead of stopping smoothly. What is the likely reason?|a) The brake force is too weak;b) The friction between the tires and the road is too low;c) The air resistance is too high;d) The bicycle is too light|b|Skidding occurs when friction is not sufficient to grip the road properly.
Increasing the roughness of the brake pads increases the friction between them and the wheel.|True,False|True|Rougher surfaces tend to have more microscopic contact points, which increases friction.
Lubricating the bicycle’s brake pads will improve braking efficiency.|True,False|False|Lubricants reduce friction, and in braking systems, lower friction means less effective braking.
