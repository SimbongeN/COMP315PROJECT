If a streetlight produces 800 lumens at a distance of 2 meters, what will be the intensity at 4 meters, assuming the inverse square law?|a) 200 lumens;b) 400 lumens;c) 100 lumens;d) 500 lumens|c|The inverse square law states that intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. If the distance doubles, how does the intensity change?
A streetlight is installed 5 meters above the ground. To increase brightness on the road, what is the best approach?|a) Increase the height of the streetlight;b) Decrease the height of the streetlight;c) Increase the wattage of the bulb;d) Use a more focused beam|d|Hint: Think about how light distribution works—raising or lowering the streetlight affects coverage, but what affects focus and intensity?
If the intensity of a streetlight at 3 meters is 300 lux, what would be the intensity at 6 meters?|a) 150 lux;b) 75 lux;c) 100 lux;d) 50 lux|b|Apply the inverse square law. What happens to intensity when the distance is doubled?
Which factor does NOT affect the intensity of streetlights?|a) Distance from the light source;b) Reflective properties of nearby surfaces;c) The height of the pole;d) The color of the streetlight pole|d|Some factors influence brightness directly while others are purely cosmetic. Which one here is just for appearance?
What happens if a streetlight is placed too high?|a) Light intensity increases;b) Light spreads out more, reducing intensity;c) Shadows decrease;d) The inverse square law no longer applies|b|Light spreads as it moves away from the source. What does this do to intensity at ground level?
If a 100W streetlight operates for 10 hours per night, how much energy does it consume in one day?|a) 1 kWh;b) 10 kWh;c) 0.1 kWh;d) 1000 kWh|a|Energy consumption is calculated as Power (W) × Time (hours) / 1000 to get kWh.
What is the main advantage of using LED streetlights instead of traditional incandescent bulbs?|a) They are cheaper to install;b) They consume less power for the same brightness;c) They produce more heat;d) They require frequent replacement|b|Think about efficiency—LEDs produce the same amount of light while using much less energy.
A city replaces 500 streetlights (each consuming 150W) with LED lights consuming only 50W. If each light operates for 12 hours per night, how much energy is saved per night?|a) 1000 kWh;b) 500 kWh;c) 600 kWh;d) 1200 kWh|c|First, calculate the total energy used before and after the switch, then find the difference.
A smart lighting system reduces energy consumption by 40% using dimmers at low-traffic hours. If the original energy consumption was 500 kWh per month, how much energy is saved?|a) 100 kWh;b) 200 kWh;c) 300 kWh;d) 400 kWh|b|Calculate 40% of 500 kWh to find the reduction.
Increasing streetlight brightness always improves visibility.|True,False|True|More brightness can create more glare, making it harder to see. Is it always about more light, or is it about the right amount?
Fog reduces streetlight effectiveness by scattering light.|True,False|False|In foggy conditions, light gets scattered in many directions, which can reduce how far the light travels and how well it illuminates the area.
