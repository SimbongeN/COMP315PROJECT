What part of the wind turbine captures the wind?|A) Tower;B) Blades;C) Base;D) Motor|B|Modern blades span 50-80m (longer than a Boeing 747 wingspan).
What energy conversion occurs in a wind turbine?|A) Mechanical to light;B) Chemical to thermal;C) Kinetic to electrical;D) Magnetic to thermal|C|Typical conversion efficiency: 30-45% of wind energy to electricity.
True or false: Blade shape affects how much wind energy a turbine can capture.|A) True;B) False|A|Airfoil-shaped blades increase efficiency by 300% vs flat blades.
Which wind condition produces the most energy?|A) No wind;B) Gentle breeze;C) Consistent strong wind;D) Storms|C|Ideal range: 12-25 m/s (cut-off at 25 m/s for safety).
What happens if a turbine spins too fast?|A) It produces more energy safely;B) It breaks or overheats;C) It becomes quieter;D) Nothing|B|Brakes engage at ~25 rpm to prevent damage.
