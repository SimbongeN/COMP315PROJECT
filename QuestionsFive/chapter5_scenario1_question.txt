Why is calculating the village's daily electricity consumption essential?|A) To guess the number of solar panels needed;B) To determine the system size required to meet demand;C) To show villagers their current energy bills;D) It's unnecessary—Ethan can use standard sizes|B|Ethan sizes the system to avoid blackouts or wasted resources.
Solar panels produce electricity in what form?|A) AC (Alternating Current) only;B) DC (Direct Current), which can be converted to AC;C) Both AC and DC simultaneously;D) Neither—they store energy directly in batteries|B|Household appliances need AC, but panels generate DC.
Batteries can store solar energy for nighttime use. Is this statement true or false?|A) True;B) False|A|Batteries store excess daytime energy for use after sunset.
To maximize sunlight capture in the Northern Hemisphere, Ethan advises facing panels:|A) North;B) South;C) East;D) West|B|Solar panels face the equator for optimal exposure.
What's the main advantage of high-wattage solar panels?|A) They require less space for the same output;B) They work better in rainy seasons;C) They last twice as long as low-wattage panels;D) They eliminate the need for batteries|A|Fewer high-wattage panels = lower installation costs.
Cleaning solar panels regularly has no impact on efficiency. Is this statement true or false?|A) True;B) False|B|Dust and dirt can reduce efficiency by 15–25%!
Which component protects the system by shutting it off during faults?|A) Safety disconnect switch;B) Extra solar panels;C) A cooling fan;D) Diesel generator backup|A|Safety first! This prevents fires or damage.
Solar systems reduce carbon emissions compared to diesel generators. Is this statement true or false?|A) True;B) False|A|Solar is clean energy; diesel emits CO2 and pollutants.
