Ethan measures a 50m^2 rooftop. Why is catchment area critical?|A) To size storage tanks accurately;B) To predict water quality;C) To determine pipe colors;D) To count city population|A|Water collected (L) = Area (m^2) × Rainfall (mm) × 0.8 (roof coefficient). *Ethan sketches the equation on his blueprint.*
With 800mm annual rainfall, how much water can Ethan's 50m^2 roof collect yearly?|A) 32 000L;B) 40 000L;C) 4 000L;D) 800L|B|50m^2 × 800mm × 0.8 = ___L (convert mm to m). *Ethan shows the step-by-step math.*
Rainwater harvesting reduces groundwater depletion. True or False?|A) True;B) False|A|Explanation: 1m^3 harvested = 1m^3 less groundwater extracted. *Ethan compares well levels before/after installation.*
Ethan selects a first-flush diverter to:|A) Discard initial contaminated runoff;B) Increase flow rate;C) Add minerals;D) Reduce tank size|A|Hint: First 1-2mm of rain carries 90% of pollutants. *He demonstrates with a water quality test kit.*
Why does Ethan add a sand filter after the diverter?|A) To remove sediments/bacteria;B) To change water color;C) To increase temperature;D) To reduce volume|A|Hint: Filters improve water to WHO standards. *Ethan shows clean vs. unfiltered samples.*
Rainwater systems pay back their cost in 5-7 years in water-scarce cities. True or False?|A) True;B) False|A|Explanation: Ethan's cost-benefit chart shows municipal water savings over time.
If the city uses 10 000L/day, what tank size is needed for a 30-day dry season?|A) 300 000L;B) 10 000L;C) 30 000L;D) 100 000L|A|Daily use × Drought days. *Ethan explains oversizing for climate uncertainty.*
Rainwater harvesting mitigates flood risks. True or False?|A) True;B) False|A|Explanation: Capturing 50m^2 of runoff reduces stormwater surges. *Ethan overlays flood maps.*
