Ethan uses a microscope to show microplastics. These are:|A) Plastic pieces >5cm;B) Particles <5mm from broken-down plastics;C) Only plastic microbeads;D) Plastic that dissolves in water|B|1 liter of seawater can contain 10,000 microplastic pieces. *Ethan displays water samples under magnification.*
