Ethan defines "carbon footprint" as measuring:|A) Water usage;B) Greenhouse gas emissions from activities;C) Employee count;D) Profit margins|B|CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) includes methane, nitrous oxide, etc. *Ethan shows a pie chart of emission sources.*
Tracking the bakery's 2000 kWh monthly energy use helps Ethan:|A) Raise electricity bills;B) Find efficiency opportunities;C) Count baking trays;D) Measure flour use|B|1 kWh from coal = 0.9 kg CO2. *Ethan compares energy bills before/after upgrades.*
LED bulbs cut the bakery's lighting energy by 60%. True or False?|A) True;B) False|A|Explanation: 100W incandescent → 16W LED for same light. *Ethan demonstrates with a wattage meter.*
To reduce delivery emissions, Ethan suggests:|A) Electric cargo bikes for local orders;B) More diesel truck trips;C) Idling engines longer;D) Avoiding mileage logs|A|1 km by diesel van = 0.3 kg CO2 vs. 0.05 kg by e-bike. *Ethan maps optimized routes.*
Local flour reduces emissions because:|A) Transport distance decreases;B) Wheat grows faster;C) Bags are prettier;D) Mills use less water|A|Hint: 100 km transport = 5 kg CO2 vs. 10 km = 0.5 kg. *Ethan labels a supply chain map.*
Better bakery insulation lowers AC costs. True or False?|A) True;B) False|A|Explanation: 10cm insulation cuts heating energy by 30%. *Ethan uses a thermal camera demo.*
New efficient ovens save 1200 kg CO2/year. Why track this?|A) To prove ROI for $ upgrades;B) To ignore savings;C) To burn more gas;D) To reduce baking time|A|Payback = (Upfront cost) ÷ (Annual savings). *Ethan shares a 3-year ROI spreadsheet.*
Small businesses collectively impact climate change. True or False?|A) True;B) False|A|Explanation: 10,000 bakeries cutting 1 ton CO2 each = 10 kilotons reduction. *Ethan graphs cumulative impact.*
