What is the primary function of a windmill?|A) Producing electricity;B) Generating wind;C) Storing water;D) Cooling the air|A|Think about what modern wind turbines do—do they create wind or use it?
Which factor affects how much power a windmill generates?|A) The color of the blades;B) The speed of the wind;C) The height of the windmill;D) The temperature of the air |B|A windmill relies on something that moves through the air—what factor changes how much energy it captures?
If the wind speed is cut in half, how does the windmill’s power output change?|A) It stays the same;B) It reduces by half;C) It reduces to a quarter;D) It doubles|C|Wind power isn't directly proportional to speed—it depends on speed raised to a power.
The windmill’s blades are not spinning. What should Alex check first?|A) The color of the paint;B) The rotation mechanism;C) The weight of the windmill;D) The number of blades|B|If something isn’t moving, what part would you check first?
What type of force causes the windmill blades to turn?|A) Gravity;B) Friction;C) Aerodynamic lift and drag;D) Magnetic force |C| Windmill blades work like airplane wings—what forces act on them?
If Ethan wants the blades to capture more wind energy, what should they do?|A) Make the blades heavier;B) Increase the blade surface area;C) Shorten the blades;D) Paint the blades a darker color|B|More surface area means more wind can be captured—how does that affect energy generation?
The gears of the windmill are rusted. What can Alex apply to reduce friction?|A) Sand;B) Oil or lubricant;C) Water;D) Glue|B|Rust increases friction. What substance is used to make parts move smoothly?
Ethan was discouraged from fixing the windmill by Mr. Patel.|A)True;B)False|B|Mr. Patel encouraged Alex to repair it.
Ethan used scientific principles to repair the windmill.|A)True;B)False|A|Scientific methods were key to the repair.
The windmill was working perfectly before Alex arrived.|A)True;B)False|B|It was broken and needed fixing.
If friction in the gear system reduces power output by 30%, what is the actual power if the windmill was supposed to generate 1000W?|A) 700W;B) 900W;C) 1000W;D) 300W|A| If friction takes away 30% of power, how much remains from 1000W?
What is the main advantage of placing the windmill on a tall tower?|A) It looks better;B) It catches stronger and more consistent winds;C) It keeps animals away;D) It makes maintenance easier|B|Wind is stronger at higher altitudes—what’s the advantage of building taller?
